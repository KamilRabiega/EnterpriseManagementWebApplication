Enterprise Management Application

This project is an enterprise management application created for my thesis. I will use technologies such as ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, C#, EntityFramework Core and more to create an enterprise management application.

There are 6 roles in the application: 

•User - a regular user, this role will be able to check the work schedule,

•Production - for production staff, this group will be able to add new product that has been created, see all products created by this departament, edit products, search for products, check the schedule and maybe some other functions in the future, 

•Magazine - for magaziners, this role can recive products from production departament, release the product to recipient, check the schedule, 

•Finance - this role will be responsible for enterprise finances such as payments and expenses, 

•Board - the board's responsibilities include features such as production scheduling (how much work there is to do for the day, week or month), they will be able to see all of payment, salaries and so on, 

•Admin - testing, fixing, creating and updating software for enterprise.

The project is still in progress.
